# blazeDiscordBot
My very own Discord bot that I made. It is an all-purpose bot. Somewhat unfinished but it's mostly there :)

It was my very very first project. I started it when I didn't know anything about JavaScript or coding beside very basic variables and loops. This means a lot to me as I've learned a lot of coding concepts and applied them to my bot over the (around a year) development period. It lit up the fire and my motivation for programming.

...Hence, the code is absolutely garbage with around negative comments. I'm just putting it here for... memories, I guess? lol

I do want to say thank you to everyone who helped me along my journey and made this bot, and where I am with my programming skills right now, complete and possible. Especially my king Duro, you have my complete respect and gratitude

:)
